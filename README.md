# docker-ice
A Dockerized version of Ice, Netflix's AWS Usage tool.

# Introduction

This is a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/) to create a container that runs the [AWS Usage tool Ice by Netflix](https://github.com/Netflix/ice). From the [Netflix's Ice repository](https://github.com/Netflix/ice) introduction:

> Ice provides a birds-eye view of our large and complex cloud landscape
> from a usage and cost perspective. Cloud resources are dynamically
> provisioned by dozens of service teams within the organization and any
> static snapshot of resource allocation has limited value. The ability
> to trend usage patterns on a global scale, yet decompose them down to
> a region, availability zone, or service team provides incredible
> flexibility. Ice allows us to quantify our AWS footprint and to make
> educated decisions regarding reservation purchases and reallocation of
> resources.
> 
> Ice is a Grails project. It consists of three parts: processor, reader
> and UI. Processor processes the Amazon detailed billing file into data
> readable by reader. Reader reads data generated by processor and
> renders them to UI. UI queries reader and renders interactive graphs
> and tables in the browser.
