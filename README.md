# Ice, Ice Baby 

This is a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/) to create a container that runs the [AWS Usage tool Ice by Netflix](https://github.com/Netflix/ice). From the [Netflix's Ice repository](https://github.com/Netflix/ice) introduction:

> Ice provides a birds-eye view of our large and complex cloud landscape
> from a usage and cost perspective. Cloud resources are dynamically
> provisioned by dozens of service teams within the organization and any
> static snapshot of resource allocation has limited value. The ability
> to trend usage patterns on a global scale, yet decompose them down to
> a region, availability zone, or service team provides incredible
> flexibility. Ice allows us to quantify our AWS footprint and to make
> educated decisions regarding reservation purchases and reallocation of
> resources.
> 
> Ice is a Grails project. It consists of three parts: processor, reader
> and UI. Processor processes the Amazon detailed billing file into data
> readable by reader. Reader reads data generated by processor and
> renders them to UI. UI queries reader and renders interactive graphs
> and tables in the browser.

More information and screenshots can be found on the [project's git page](https://github.com/Netflix/ice). 

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites 

 - Sign up for Amazon's programmatic billing access [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/detailed-billing-reports.html) to receive detailed billing(hourly) reports. Verify you receive monthly billing file in the following format: <accountid>-aws-billing-detailed-line-items-<year>-<month>.csv.zip.
 - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.

## Docker Setup

Open `docker-compose.yml` and add the AWS Access Key ID and Secret Key that has access to the s3  billing bucket.   

    ice:
      build: ice
      command: |
        -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true
        -Djava.net.preferIPv4Addresses
        -Dice.s3AccessKeyId=<s3AccessKeyId>
        -Dice.s3SecretKey=<s3SecretKeyId> 
       
       
----------
     
Create a configuration file:  `cp ice/assets/sample.properties ice/assets/ice.properties`
Open the configuration file:  `vi ice/assets/ice.properties` and configure your basic setup by updating the following:
    
    # S3 bucket name where the billing files are
    ice.billing_s3bucketname=
    
    # Your company name
    ice.companyName=	
    
    # S3 bucket name where Ice can store output files
    ice.work_s3bucketname=
	
	# prefix of Ice output files
	ice.work_s3bucketprefix=
    
    # Your AWS account number. You can also replace "production" with your own identifier 
    ice.account.production=


More information on the configurations can be found on the [project's git page](https://github.com/Netflix/ice).
